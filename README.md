Neek's Professional Portfolio: http://neekode.com

Hosted at Digital Ocean, Domain from Hover, Continuous Deployment from Netlify.
Composed and Framework'd using React Hooks, SASS css preprocessor, using ES6 syntax, Configured using Webpack and Node (create-react-app)

Most impressive part about this project is what i call the Ballpit. It's a fancy background for my portfolio which the user can edit and modify in the Controller UI. 
It's all built with React Hooks, and remains as pure, functional, and modular as possible. It's actually available for download in a separate repo if you want it. 

Thanks for visiting!
